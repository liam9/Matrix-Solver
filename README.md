------------------Important Notes--------------------

1)As of now, only power and rank support non square matrices in this program

2)In linear algebra matrices that can be solved always have the amount of variables less than or equal to the amount of equations

3)Cramers Rule, Gaussian Inverse, and Determinant always require a square matrix

4)There are certain matrices that can't be solved with this program because the array elements use doubles instead of fractions
